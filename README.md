# Lab 8 - Starter

1. We would fit our automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is a key factor of Agile development commonly known as CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). By doing so, the developer is able to receive constant feedback on the quality and performance of the code. For example, it helps to identify bugs and errors to be addressed early in the software development process.
2. No, we would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output.
