1. We would fit our automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is a key factor of Agile development commonly known as CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). By doing so, the developer is able to receive constant feedback on the quality and performance of the code. For example, it helps to identify bugs and errors to be addressed early in the software development process.
2. NO. Unit testing would be more appropriate for testing a specific function or component of the application because it is isolating and testing individual parts, like a small functions or components, to ensure they work correctly on their own. End-to-end testing, on the other hand, tests the entire application as a whole. 
3. No,I would not use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application becuasse "write and send a message" a very fairly large-scale feature and it involves multiple small functions and compotents that interact with on another. To test the feature, we should better use end-end test because it emulates the user actions from start to finish (end to end) of the whole process.
4. Yes, because unit testing is appropriate for this small-scale feature as it can be tested independently without having evaluate multiple components' interactions.
